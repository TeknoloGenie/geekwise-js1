                Write a js program that will:

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Create an array holding the numbers 1 - 500</li>
                    <li>Using the array as the basis for a loop, remove one element per loop (pop), with the result
                    being an empty array.</li>
                    <li>What is the result?  Anything surprising happen?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Lets analyze what happened, and see how we could make this work in a way we expect.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                When we talked about <code>for</code> loops we saw that the <code>for</code> loop will evaluate the
                "condition" portion of the loop with every iteration.
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                How did this condition cause an unexpected result?
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                The answer lies in the <code>length</code> property of the array.  If you recall, it's is updated anytime
                the array is manipulated.  So with every <code>pop</code> the <code>length</code> would decrement by 1.
                As soon as i reached 250 and the array length reached 250, the loop ceases to run, which left 250 elements
                in our array.
            </div>

            <div class="point">So how do we make this work, so we end up with an empty array? Lets revisit our for loop
            syntax and see how we might be able to change that up.</div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var a = [];

//create an array holding 500 items
for (var i = 1; i <= 500; i++) {
    a.push(i);
}

//loop over the array, poping one item off the list
//with every iteration.  Notice, we are using the length
//of the array for our condition, which evaluates on
//every loop.
for (var j = 0; j < a.length; j++) {
    a.pop();
}

console.log(a);
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                So what we really want is a variable that isn't going to keep changing with every loop, right?  Check
                out the alternative syntax.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
for (var i = 0, len = a.length; i < len; i++) {
    a.pop();
}
    </code>
</pre>
            <div class="point">Notice the comma and the <code>len</code> variable that's being created
                <strong>before</strong> we get to the condition. This means that the variable <code>a.length</code> will
                               only be calculated <strong>once</strong>
                <div class="excercise">

                    In javascript, we can concat two strings using the <code>+</code> operator.  Yes, the same one we
                    use for math.

                    However, watch out when trying to concat a string and a number, javascript will attempt to be "helpful"
                    and convert the number into a string.  This is called <strong>type casting</strong>.

                    It's essentially saying "Hey, you're trying to concat values of different types, so I'm going to
                    convert one of them for you so the concat will work.

                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    Array indexes (as well as other indexes we'll discuss later) all start with 0.  So in the example above,

                    Awesome, I can get my data back out of an array once I put it in, how do I add more things to it?

                <div class="point">
                    Javascript Array's provide a function called <code>push</code> that allows for adding items to the
                    <strong>end</strong> of an array.

                    <div class="excercise">
                        Try it: Add a new fruit to the end of your fruits array using the <code>fruits.push(...)</code>
                        function.

</pre>

                <div class="point">
                    When you add items to your array, the <code>length</code> property is automatically updated for you.

    <code class="language-javascript">
var a = [1];
console.log(a.length);

a.push(2);

                <div class="point">
                    Array's can also contain other arrays.

//create an array to hold multiple arrays
var fruitColors = [];

                    <div class="excercise">
                        Try it: create a snippet that will create an array to hold multiple arrays (defined above).

                <div class="point">
                    So now we can create Arrays, access array properties, and add items to arrays, how about removing
                    items?
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    Items can be removed one at a time <strong>from the end</strong> of the array, using the <code>pop</code>
                    function. NOTE: This modifies the original array
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    Another handy array function we'll talk about is the <code>slice</code> function.  It works on arrays a little
                    differently.
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    The <code>slice</code> function will make a copy of the specified indexes and return them in a new
                    array.
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    The <strong>signature</strong> of the slice function looks like:
                    <code class="language-javascript">fruits.slice(begin, [end])</code>
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    The <code>begin</code> is the zero based starting index, and the <code>end</code> is the index to
                    stop at.  NOTE: The extraction does not include the end index!

                    <div class="excercise">
                        Try it: Create an array with 4 strings, then slice the middle two.
                    </div>
                </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var fruits = ["apple", "cherry", "plum", "apricot"];
console.log(fruits.slice(1, 3));
console.log(fruits); //note, it's the same as the original array.
    </code>
</pre>

                <div class="point">
                    One point to remember about the <code>slice</code> functions is that is <strong>does not</strong>
                    modify the original array.  But what if we actually did want to modify the original?
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    <code>splice</code> to the rescue!  The splice function works in a similar way to the slice function,
                    however it allows you to modify the original array.
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    The <strong>signature</strong> of the splice function looks like:
                </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
fruits.splice(begin, howManyToRemove, [additional, items, to, add]);
    </code>
</pre>

                <div class="point">
                    So <code>begin</code> is our starting index, <code>howManyToRemove</code> is how many items to remove
                    from the starting index, and additional items to add are more elements that you want to add to the
                    array (comma separated values).

                <div class="point">
                    First, we'll cover <code>while</code> loops.  <code>while</code> loops work by evaluating a condition,
                    if the condition is true, the loop "fires", executing all code it contains, once the condition becomes
                    false, the loop stops.
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    One important concept with while loops is that you must write the code that will make the condition
                    false, otherwise you get an infinite loop.

                    <div class="excercise">

                    The <code>do / while</code> loop is less commonly used, however it's a useful tool to have once you
                    understand how it's used.
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    The <code>do / while</code> loop will <strong>always</strong> run at least once, <strong>then</strong>
                    it evaluates it's condition.  If the condition is still true, it will continue the loop.

                <div class="point">

                    Javascript provides two ways of controlling the flow of a loop, the <code>continue</code> and <code>

                <div class="point">

                    loop.  It's basically just saying, disregard the rest of this loop and go to the next loop.

                <div class="point">
                    So all our work with arrays up to this point has been retrieving array indexes one at a time using
                    a numbered bracket notation, IE <code>fruits[3]</code>.  This is useful, but what if your application
                    requirements were such that you needed to do something to every element in the array?
                </div>

                <div class="point">
                    LOOP ALL THE THINGS! A for loop is a perfect mechanism for iterating over each element in an array.

                        Try it: How would you create a for loop and log all the items in our fruit array to the console?

            <div class="point">
                We've talked about functions during our first few classes, but up until now we've not really looked at
                what they are, how they work, and most importantly, how we can write our own.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Lets define a javascript function as: <strong>a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a
                                                              value</strong>
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Functions allow you to perform a series of tasks, and return a value that can be used later.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                If a function does not return a value, it will automatically return <code>undefined</code>.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                All javascript datatypes have different functions that work on them.  For example:

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Arrays have <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, etc...</li>
                    <li>Strings have <code>split</code>, <code>charAt</code>, etc...</li>
                    <li>Objects have <code>hasOwnProperty</code></li>
                </ul>

                These functions are all built into each datatypes.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
//string method, turns string into an array
//NOTE TO SELF...YOU MIGHT NEED THIS LATER...JUST SAYIN
var movie = "The Shawshank Redemption";
var moviePieces = movie.split(" ");
console.log(moviePieces);

//array method, turns array into string
console.log(moviePieces.join(" "));
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Ok, so we know that javascript has built in functions that perform tasks on certain datatypes, but wouldn't
                it be nice if we could write our own functions?
            </div>

            <h3>Creating your first function</h3>

            <div class="point">
                To define a function requires four things:

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>The <code>function</code> keyword followed by...</li>
                    <li>The name of the function</li>
                    <li>A list of arguments to the functions enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas</li>
                    <li>The statements that define the functions enclosed in curly brackets</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Create a function that logs "hello world" to the console.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("hello world");
}
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Lets pick that apart line by line:

                <ol class="list">
                    <li><code>function helloWorld() {</code> - the <code>function</code> keyword followed by an arbitrary
                    function name.  In this case <strong>helloWorld</strong>.  The function does not take any arguments
                    so we just have an empty set of parentheses.  Then we have an opening curly bracket to start our
                    javascript statements.</li>
                    <li><code>console.log("hello world");</code> - the functions body.  In this case, we are simply logging
                    "hello world" to the console.</li>
                    <li><code>}</code> - closing curly brace, ends our function definition</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="point">Great, run that in the console.  What happens?</div>

            <div class="point">Javascript functions need to be "called" or "invoked".  Simply writing the function
            only makes the javascript interpreter aware that it exists, it does not call it right away.</div>

            <div class="point">You call a function by using it's name, followed by a set of parenthesis.  Recall other
            functions we've used, the functions are always called with the parentheses.  <code>console.log(...)</code>
            <code>a.push(...)</code>, etc...</div>

            <div class="point">So, lets call our function
                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: alter your code to call the function
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("hello world");
}

helloWorld();
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">Now you should see your console.log appear.  So we called the function, and javascript
            executed the code found inside it.</div>

            <div class="point">
                Now, lets create a function that takes 1 argument, and log that to the console instead of the hard coded
                "hello world" string.  While were at it lets rename it to something more appropriate, like <code>log</code>.

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Create a function called log that accepts one argument, and logs it to the console.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function log(stuff) {
    console.log(stuff);
}

log("the fox jumps over the lazy dog");
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Notice, we do not use the <code>var</code> keyword when working with our function arguments.  The arguments
                are scoped to that function (more on this later).
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Call your <code>log</code> function without passing any arguments, what gets logged to the
                    console?
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="point">Great, now we're getting somewhere, we can define our own functions that accept arguments
            and do something with them.  It's also worth pointing out that functions can also call other functions.</div>

            <div class="point">
                Lets try something a little more complicated, but more useful.  It would be really nice if we had a way
                to capitalize a string, for proper names, etc...  Maybe js provides a nice way to do this:

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Lets check and see if js provides a string capitalize function...
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var name = "greg";
var capped = name.capitalize();

console.log(capped);

>> TypeError: undefined is not a function
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Lets look a little closer at that error... <code>undefined is not a function</code>.  In our example,
                we are calling two functions, <code>name.capitalize()</code> and <code>console.log()</code>.  Which one
                is likely giving us the problem?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Since we know <code>console.log()</code> is a real function, it's likely that javascript is telling us
                that <code>name.capitalize</code> is undefiend, and thus when we try and call it, it's not a function.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                While js does not provide a way of capitalizing the first letter of a string, it does provide a way to
                upper case an entire string. It looks like <code>"greg".toUpperCase()</code>.

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Create a string (variable or directly inline) and use the toUpperCase function on it.  What
                    is your result?
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
console.log("greg".toUpperCase());
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                The result should be an entirely uppercase string.  So how can we use this to our advantage if we
                wanted to write a function that will capitalize just the first letter?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Also, we want this function to accept a string and capitalize it, we need to be able to get that value
                back out of the function, this is where the <code>return</code> keyword is used.  <code>return</code> will
                return the specified value out of the function so you can use it else where.

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Lets discuss how you might tackle creating a capitalized string using methods we've discussed
                    in the last few classes.  Hint: <code>toUpperCase</code>, string indexes, and <code>slice</code>.
                </div>

                <div class="sidenote">
                    In javascript <strong>strings</strong> are <strong>not mutable</strong>.  This means that when you
                    take any action on a string, you're actually creating a new string.  So it's important to realize that
                    since I can't actually change the string "greg" into "Greg", we can fake it by creating another string.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function capitalize(str) {
    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
    </code>
</pre>

            <h3>Handling Edge Cases</h3>

            <div class="point">
                When writing functions (or any js program, really), it's very important to consider edge cases.  As a
                developer, it's your job to anticipate odd ways your function might be used and make sure it handles
                those cases.  What happens if you call your capitalize function on an empty string?  How can we fix that?
                What other edge cases might be useful to consider?
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
//this handles our case when no string is passed in (str is "falsy")
function capitalize(str) {
    if (!str) {
        return "";
    }

    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Notice the function now contains two return points, one for the case where we don't have a string, and
                one where we do.  It's also important to understand that a function will stop executing any code following
                a return statement, so if no string is passed in, nothing past <code>return "";</code> will be executed.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                What about making sure that the argument passed into the function is actually a string?
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                The <code>typeof</code> operator is helpful here.  <code>typeof</code> operator will evaluate the type
                of thing we are working with, and return that value as a string.

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: Use the <code>typeof</code> keyword to detect the type of thing we're dealing with.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var name = "greg";
console.log(typeof name);
console.log(typeof 3);
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                So, how can we use typeof to ensure the argument is a string?
                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: alter your original capitalize function to ensure that a value is passed in, and that it's
                    a string.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function capitalize(str) {
    if (!str || typeof str !== "string") {
        return str;
    }

    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                It's often these "edge cases" that will bite you in the long run.  Always begin thinking about odd ways
                someone might use your code and anticipate how you could handle it!
            </div>

            <h3>The <code>arguments</code> keyword</h3>

            <div class="point">
                This is more of an advanced topic, but worth mentioning here.  Inside any javascript function, you will
                have available to use an array like object called <code>arguments</code>.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                I say array like because it looks like an array, but is actually missing many of the functions arrays
                have to work with.  However, it does contain a <code>length</code> property.
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                Lets take a look at how the <code>arguments</code> variable works.

                <div class="excercise">
                    Try it: lets create a function that will add up all of the arguments we pass into it.  In all other
                    cases we've looked at, you must map the arguments being passed into the function, to the function
                    declaration itself, so the <code>arguments</code> variable will actually let us handle an arbitrary
                    number of arguments.  This means we don't need to define the arguments in the function <strong>signature</strong>.
                </div>
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function adder() {
    console.log(arguments);
}
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Lets finish this function by making it add up all of the arguments we pass into it.  Anything non numberish
                should be ignored.  For instance, if I call <code>adder(1, 2, "foo")</code>, the result should be 3.
            </div>

            <h3>Function Scope</h3>

            <div class="point">Every js program runs with a "scope".  This can be thought of as the things that are
            currently available to the execution of a program.  The main / base scope is referred to as the "global"
            scope.</div>

            <div class="point">
                Creating a function in javascript creates a new scope
            </div>

            <div class="point">
                One important thing to understand is that code <strong>outside</strong> of a function can not access any
                code <code>inside</code> the function.
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
function foo() {
    var a = "inside foo";
    return a;
}

console.log(a); //undefined, because "a" is "scoped" to the foo function
console.log(foo()); //should log "inside foo" because the function was called, and a value returned
    </code>
</pre>

            <div class="point">
                Got it, code outside of a function can't access anything other than what's returned from a function.  So
                it stands to reason that code inside a function can't access anything outside of the function either?
            </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var name = "greg";

function capitalize() {
    return name[0].toUpperCase() + name.slice(1);
}

var capitalizedName = capitalize();
console.log(capitalizedName);
    </code>
</pre>

        <div class="point">
            Ah, maybe not what you expected?  Functions do have access to the variables and other functions that exists
            in outer scopes (which, when you think about it, is why you can console.log(...) something inside of a
            function.
        </div>

        <h3>Function Expressions and other Gotchas</h3>

        <div class="point">
            So now we know how to write a function, but there are other ways to do it as well.  You'll surely encounter
            them in the wild so it's nice to know what's going on when you see them.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            Functions in javascript are "first class".  This means they can be passed as arguments to other functions,
            returned from other functions, and assigned to variables (instead of being a named function).
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            When a function is assigned to a variable, it's called a <strong>function expression</strong>.

            <div class="excercise">
                Try it: Create a function expression that assigned a function to a variable.
            </div>
        </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var capitalize = function (str) {
    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
};
    </code>
</pre>


        <div class="point">
            So what is different here.  Notice, the function declaration does not have a name.  This is what is known as
            an <code>Anonymous function</code>, or a function with no name.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            If it has no name, how do we call it?  Same way we do with other functions, but we use the variable name
            instead.  In the case of the capitalize function above, we can call it as <code>capitalize("greg")</code>.

            <div class="excercise">
                Try it: Create and execute a function expression.
            </div>
        </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var capitalize = function (str) {
    if (!str) {
        return "";
    }

    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
};

console.log(capitalize("greg"));
    </code>
</pre>

        <div class="point">
            One thing to note about anonymous functions, they don't actually have to be anonymous.  In fact, it's good
            practice to name all your functions, for the purposes of error reporting.  The function below will work
            just the same.
        </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var capitalize = function capitalize(str) {
    if (!str) {
        return "";
    }

    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
};

console.log(capitalize("greg"));
    </code>
</pre>

        <div class="point">
            Now, lets try an experiment.  Lets create a new function (not a function expression) called <code>logName</code>.
            Then, above that code, lets call <code>logName</code>.  What would you expect to happen?
        </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
logName("greg");

function logName(name) {
    console.log(name);
}
    </code>
</pre>

        <div class="point">
            This is due to something javascipt is doing called <code>hoisting</code>.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            Even though javascript executes <strong>linearly</strong>, variable and function definitions are actually
            "hoisted" to the top of the scope.  So even though we call logName before we define it, javascript is actually
            recognizing the definition of the function, hoisting it to the top of the scope, which makes it available to
            call before the definition in the code actually happens.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            Is the same true of function expressions?

            <div class="excercise">
                Try it: Call a function expression before it's defined.  What happens?
            </div>
        </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
foo("greg");

var foo = function (name) {
    console.log(name);
};
    </code>
</pre>

        <div class="point">
            So what happend there?  Why did we get the <code>undefined is not a function</code>?
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            The reason for this is that <strong>only</strong> named function definitions and variable declarations are
            hoisted.  The <strong>values</strong> of the variables are not hoisted.
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            Lets look at this a little closer.  What would you expect to happen in the example below?
        </div>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
var name = "Greg";

function alertName() {
    alert(name);

    var name = "Jules";

    alert(name);
}

alertName();
    </code>
</pre>

            Create a program that will:

            <ul class="list">
                <li>Start by creating an array of your top 10 favorite movies, the titles should be all lowercase</li>
                <li>Create a function called capitalize that will accept a string as an argument, capitalize that string,
                    and return the capitalized value.  Please consider edge cases.</li>
                <li>Create a loop that will loop over all movies in your movies array.</li>
                <li>Inside each loop, you should capitalize the movie name and set the value in the array.</li>
                <li>After the loop has been completed, log the movies to the console.  The result should be that the
